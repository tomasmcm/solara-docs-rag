# Tutorials

Instead of having one tutorial, we have tutorials for different audiences.

  * [Data science](/docs/tutorial/data-science): In this tutorial, we will introduce Solara from the perspective of a data scientist or when you are thinking of using Solara for a data science app.
  * [Web app](/docs/tutorial/web-app): You are not a data scientist, but you are interested in using Solara to create a web app using Pure Python.
  * [IPywidgets user](/docs/tutorial/ipywidgets): If you are already using [ipywidgets](/docs/understanding/ipywidgets) you will learn how to use the [Solara server](/docs/understanding/solara-server) to render your regular ipywidget applications.
  * [Streamlit](/docs/tutorial/streamlit): If you are an existing Streamlit user, this might appeal more to you.
